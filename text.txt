Twenty-five years Dana had been waiting. 
She tried to be patient during that time but she hadn't always managed to be as patient as she'd like. 
But today the opportunity had finally come. 
The thing she always imagined would make her the happiest person in the world was about to happen.
She didn't know why at this specific time she all of a sudden felt sick inside.
Here's the thing. She doesn't have anything to prove, but she is going to anyway. 
That's just her character. She knows she doesn't have to, but she still will just to show you that she can. 
Doubt her more and she'll prove she can again. We all already know this and you will too.
